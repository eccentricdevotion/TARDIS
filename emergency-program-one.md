# Emergency Program One

Emergency Program One works hand in hand with the TARDIS Autonomous function and TARDIS malfunctions. If the Autonomous
function is on, and the Time Lord dies, companions in the TARDIS will see Emergency Program One. Likewise if a
malfunction occurs, Emergency Program One will also appear.

### To set up Emergency Program One

Versions of TARDIS prior to v4.4.1 require the [Citizens](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/citizens/) plugin, so
install that first!

Use `/tardisprefs` command to turn the Autonomous function on:

    /tardisprefs auto on

Use `/tardisprefs` command to turn the Emergency Program One on:

    /tardisprefs eps on

You can change the message that the Emergency Program One NPC says:

    /tardisprefs eps_message [The message]

The Emergency Program One NPC will go away automatically in TARDIS v4.4.1 and higher, in lower versions, just
right-click it to make it disappear.

### Other

You can make Emergency Program One appear at any time using the command:

    /tardis ep1

### Video

Emergency Program One starts at approximately 01:15
