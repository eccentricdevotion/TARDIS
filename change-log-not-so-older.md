- Fixed a nasty bug with HADS — DISPERSAL was running when the HADS type was set to DISPLACEMENT and a safe location

### TARDIS v3.4.2

#### Additions

- Added a config option `preferences.vortex_fall: [teleport|kill]` so that players that fall into the time vortex are
  not kicked for flying. This setting really only applies if the TARDIS WorldGuard region flag is set to `exit: deny`
    - `teleport` will send the players back into the TARDIS they were in
    - `kill` will set the players’ health to `0`, resulting in death
- Added a `/tardistravel cancel` command — cancels the last set destination
- Added `/ttravel costs` command — shows the Artron Energy costs for TARDIS travel

#### Changes

- If the `/tardistravel` command receives a world name and two coordinates, it now automatically determines the highest
  Y block
- When switching to the `exit: deny` flag on TARDIS WorldGuard regions, the `use: allow` flag is also now added so that
  players can interact with doors, buttons and pressure plates etc.
- The time travel cost is now shown in the Artron Energy HUD when a destination has been set
- In the TARDIS Saved Locations GUI you can now remove saves by dragging them to the trash (a bucket)

  to `false`
- Fixed crops popping off when growing a GREEHOUSE room and `growth.room_speed` is set to default (`4`)

  bug prevented the `NEW` preset from being applied unless it was changed to something else first

### TARDIS v3.4.1

#### Additions

- Added cave and village travel to the Keyboard

#### Bug fixes

- The Vortex Junk TARDIS now properly uses the configured wall & floor blocks

  Biome Reader tool —
  see [http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/tardis/tickets/1081-tardis-medium-difficulty/](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/tardis/tickets/1081-tardis-medium-difficulty/)
- Added the TARDIS Biome Reader
    - use the `/tardisrecipe reader` command to see how to craft it
    - clicking the Biome Reader on a block will detect the biome at the player’s current location and automatically
      write a Biome Storage Disk to the Disk Storage Container if there is sufficient room and the biome disk is not
      there already
    - cannot be used in the Nether or The End
- Added a config option to prevent condensing blocks and the use of the ‘full charge’ item if the TARDIS world is set to
  gamemode CREATIVE
    - `preferences.no_creative_condense: [true|false]`
- Added an admin command for setting the `artron_furnace.particles` config option
  — `/tardisadmin particles [true|false]`
- Added commands to allow the Junk TARDIS wall and floor blocks to be set
    - `/tardisjunk <wall|floor> [material]`
    - the `[material]` options are the same as when setting the wall or floor for TARDIS rooms — use tab completion!
- Added a new button to the Chameleon Construct GUI to load the last saved construct
- Added a config option to implement a TARDIS ‘open door policy’
    - config: `preferences.open_door_policy: [true|false]` — false by default — requires restart if enabled
    - command: `/tardisadmin region-flag [entry|exit]` — used to update all TARDIS regions in the default TARDIS world
      to add the specified flag (and remove its opposite). **You will need to change existing TARDIS regions** to use
      the `exit` flag if `open_door_policy` is `true`, but you only need to do this once

#### Changes

  will need to update TARDISChunkGenerator and can safely remove TARDISHelper
- Added some new API methods so that the [Dynmap-TARDIS](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/dynmap-tardis/) plugin can

  then there will be no lamp in the resulting construct
- The DESERT Chameleon preset now uses orange stained clay instead of wool to reflect the change made to desert temples
  in Minecraft

### TARDIS v3.4-beta-1

#### Additions

- Added a Junk TARDIS
    - The Junk TARDIS is a public use TARDIS that any player with the correct permission can use on the server. It only
      travels in overworlds (no Nether or The End) and doesn’t require the player to have an Artron Energy supply
    - Video here: [https://vimeo.com/139185257](https://vimeo.com/139185257)
    - **permissions:** `tardis.admin` to create, delete and return the Junk TARDIS — `tardis.junk` to fly and find the
      Junk TARDIS
    - **commands:** `/tardisjunk create` — target the centre block of a flat 6 x 6 area — this becomes the Junk TARDIS
      ‘home’ location
    - `/tardisjunk delete` — self explanatory
    - `/tardisjunk return` — returns the Junk TARDIS to its ‘home’ location (bringing along any players who may be
      onboard)

      requires [EffectLib 3.4](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/effectlib/) or higher
    - `junk.return: [time in seconds]` — if `[time in seconds]` is greater than `0` and the Junk TARDIS has not been
      used for longer than the specified period, it will automatically return to its ‘home’ location
    - **controls:** sign — shows the travel destination, handbrake — starts the TARDIS travelling, tripwire hook —
      selects the world to travel to, stone button — sets the x coordinate, wood button — sets the z coordinate,
      repeater — determines the amount added or subtracted from the x and z coordinates when the buttons are clicked,
      comparator — sets whether the buttons add or subtract
    - players moving off the Junk TARDIS while it is travelling are killed instantly

- Added a `/tardis update beacon` command

    - each TARDIS area can be set to different distances — `/tardisarea parking [area name] [distance]`
- The `tardis.ars` permission is now solely used for the ARS console — permission to use the Architectural

    - The player preference is `off` by default, but will be automatically set to `true` when creating or upgrading to
      an ELEVENTH or TWELFTH console
    - It is best left **OFF** for _existing consoles_ as the levers that power lamps cannot be placed on lanterns —
      therefore breaking the lights if they are then switched back to lamps — to get around this, up-, down- or
      cross-grade your console first — this version contains new schematics to rectify the problem

#### Changes

- By default the config option `default_world` is now **true** for new installs — this will automatically create the
  _TARDIS\_TimeVortex_ world — `create_worlds` is now defaulted to false
- The plugin now persists Villager careers when mob farming — **requires TARDISHelper v1.4**
- The plugin now checks that any dependent plugins that are on the server are the correct version for _this version of
  TARDIS_ — if not, TARDIS is disabled until they are updated
- TARDIS WorldGuard regions are updated if the player name has changed
- The plugin now uses new `player.getTargetBlock()` and `itemMeta.addItemFlags()` methods — requires an updated
  CraftBukkit / Spigot build
- Enchantment text is now hidden on Sonic Screwdrivers, Artron Storage Cells and the arrows in the Chameleon GUI
    - Requires the latest CraftBukkit / Spigot build
    - Not compatible with Multiverse-Inventories (they need to update) — change will not be applied if
      Multiverse-Inventories is enabled
- Updated the ELEVENTH and TWELFTH console schematics to use sea lanterns
    - Existing consoles can also use lanterns if you set the player preference for lanterns (see above)
- Custom consoles now have a `has_lanterns: [true|false]` config option\*
- Sea lantern can now be used as the Police Box lamp
- The plugin now sets the `CookTimeTotal` furnace entity tag in Artron Furnaces (for better burn animations) — *
  *requires TARDISHelper v1.4**

#### Bug fixes

- Fixed a TARDIS Remote Key message
- Fixed a misspelled ZERO room message
- Removed an extra word ‘command’ in the `/tardisarea` command message
- Fix anti/gravity room growing
    - Anti-Gravity / Gravity rooms now properly grow outside of the ARS grid

- Vastly improved the `/tardis help` command — it now shows pages and includes links to online documentation
- The plugin now uses Multiverse world name aliases (if they are set) when showing the scanner results, find location,
  and random destination messages
- Player permissions are now checked before the grace period on hard mode
- When accessing ARS the plugin always gets the ARS Map of the TARDIS the player is in, but only processes it if they
  are the Time Lord of that TARDIS
- Minor changes to the TARDIS API — this means that you will need to update the TARDISVortexMainpulator plugin as well (
  if you use it)

### Bug fixes

- The plugin is now disabled at startup if the installed WorldGuard plugin is the wrong version
- Fixed Guardians spawning in the TARDIS when there is no POOL room
- Fixed the minecart not returning from the RAIL room because the chunk unloads

### v3.2.9

[View requirements for this version](#reqs)

### Additions

- Added a console warning if Remote Key ingredient does not = TARDIS Key result
- Added Siege Cube protection when dropping the cube from the player’s inventory (as well as the existing case of when
  it is mined)
-

Added a config option to allow Guardians to be pulled into the TARDIS if the door is left open — it’s `false` by
default:

    allow:
        guardians: [true|false]       

- regardless of the setting, guardians will not be spawned in the TARDIS if there is _no POOL room_
- if set to `true` — any guardians within a 16 blocks radius of the open TARDIS door will be sucked into the pool
- if set to `false` — there is still a 25% chance that a random monster will spawn in the TARDIS, and a 1 in 12 chance
  that it will be a guardian
- toggle the setting with `/tardisadmin guardians [true|false]`

### Changes

- Daleks (from the TARDISWeepingAngels plugin) spawned in the TARDIS (when the door is open) will now be redisguised
  after teleportation
- If a world is deleted from the server, the plugin now attempts to clean the database of invalid block and portal
  records

### Bug fixes

- Added missing return statement that caused the TARDIS to unsiege inside itself
- Fixed some NPEs with the Artron Furnace
- Fixed repeaters not being reset after manual flight
- Blocks and portals that belong to non-existent worlds are no longer loaded

### v3.2.8

[View requirements for this version](#reqs)

### Additions

- Added a `/tardisadmin desiege [player]` command
    - Stop tracking the siege cube
    - Set siege mode to OFF
    - Rebuild the TARDIS at the home location
- Added a `/tardis cube` command to see which player is carrying the Siege Cube
- Added a `/tardisadmin list portals` command (primarily for debugging)
- Added a check / warning if GOLD\_NUGGET ingredient in the Remote Key recipe is different from the result of crafting
  the TARDIS Key — _if you have changed the recipe result of the TARDIS Key to something other than a GOLD\_NUGGET, then
  you will also need to change the matching ingredient in the Remote Key recipe!_

### Changes

- Swamp Hut preset now has a walk in portal
- You can no longer power down using the Control Menu sign if `allow.power_down` is `false` in the config
- Added `tardis.budget` as a child node of the `tardis.use` permission
- A TARDIS Key is now shown in the TARDIS Remote Key recipe (`/tardisrecipe r-key`) — _if you have changed the recipe
  result of the TARDIS Key to something other than a GOLD\_NUGGET, then you will also need to change the matching
  ingredient in the Remote Key recipe!_

### Bug fixes

- Fixed rabbit ejecting — Rabbits are not Sheep!
- Temporary fix for Swamp Hut preset popping the door off, waiting on CraftBukkit/Spigot for bugs fixed in Minecraft
  itself (toggable blocks poppng off half slabs)
- Fixed some cases where the world name was not being read/set correctly
- Fixed / added some missing default config options
- Fixed the permissions check when crafting a BUDGET seed block
- Fixed the 3-D Glasses not being white anymore — update your TARDIS resource pack

### v3.2.7

[View requirements for this version](#reqs)

#### Additions

Added a TARDIS Artron Furnace — requires TARDISHelper v1.2 (included in ZIP file)

- `/tardisrecipe furnace`
- permission to place a furnace: `tardis.furnace`
- Custom texture — update the [TARDIS-MCP](https://github.com/eccentricdevotion/TARDIS-MCP) resource pack
- Custom sound when burning starts — update
  the [TARDISSound](https://github.com/eccentricdevotion/TARDIS-SoundResourcePack) resource pack
- set config options in **artron.yml** :

      artron_furnace:
          burn_limit: 100000
          burn_time: 0.5
          cook_time: 0.5
          set_biome: true

- `set_biome [true|false]` — whether to set the biome so that custom textures work on the furnace block
- `cook_time: [time ratio]` — sets the cook time for items smelted with Artron Storage Cells — `0.5` is half the normal
  time, `2.0` would be twice normal speed (longer), 1 = normal cook time (same as coal)
- `burn_time: [time ratio]` — sets the length of time an Artron Storage Cell will burn for — as above fractions (`0.5`)
  will give shorter life to the cells, \> 1 will extend the burn time, 1 = normal burn time (same as coal)
- `burn_limit: [amount]` — the maximum amount of burn time a fully charged Artron Storage Cell can have.
- The actual maximum amount given is `burn_limit * burn_time * (cell_charge_level / full_charge)`
- default settings mean that the Artron Furnace cooks quickly but doesn’t burn as long.
- Added support for banner colours and patterns in TARDIS schematics

#### Bug fixes

- Fixed item duplication exploit when crafting seed blocks (again)
- Fixed invisibility potions being removed when not temporally located

    - if they click a seed block, it shows them the recipe
    - if they click the interior wall or floor blocks, it will show them the blocks they can use

#### Requirements

Do not bother posting comments / tickets if you are not running the appropriate server and plugin versions — they will
be deleted immediately!

##### Server

A new WorldBorder API was addedd to CraftBukkit / Spigot on the 13 December 2014. This means if your server JAR was
built before then it **WILL NOT WORK** with TARDIS. You should use
Spigot’s [BuildTools](https://hub.spigotmc.org/jenkins/job/BuildTools/) to compile a new server JAR — instructions for
doing this can be found here: [How to use BuildTools](build-tools.html).

- [CraftBukkit](http://tardisjenkins.duckdns.org:8080/job/BuildTools/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/craftbukkit-1.11.2.jar) —
  version git-Bukkit-1092acb (MC: 1.8) or newer

_or_

- [Spigot](http://tardisjenkins.duckdns.org:8080/job/BuildTools/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/spigot-1.11.2.jar) —

- Added the Vortex Manipulator to `/tardisrecipe` and `/tardisgive` commands — `/tardisrecipe vortex`
  and `/tardisgive [player] vortex [amount]`
- Added Vortex Manipulator tachyon energy to the give command — `/tardisgive [player] tachyon [amount]`
- Added 4 new presets: PRISMARINE, ANDESITE, DIORITE and GRANITE

  plugin schematics will be updated automatically, but custom consoles and rooms will need to be remade.
  See [http://eccentricdevotion.github.io/TARDIS/schematics.html](http://eccentricdevotion.github.io/TARDIS/schematics.html)
