# this entry is the police box door, but centred on a block
centred:
  # the material of the door item display
  material: ANGLER_POTTERY_SHERD
  # a comma separated list of frame numbers where the
  # number is added to the starting (closed) animation frame to
  # get the "custom_model_data" predicate e.g. 10000 + 3 = 10003
  # in this example, 0 => closed, 4 => fully open, but for a simple door
  # 0,1 would be just closed and open
  # door states will need to be saved as separate JSON model files
  # in assets/tardis/models/item/doors/ with the following naming scheme (where xxx = the name value above):
  # open - assets/tardis/models/item/doors/xxx_open.json
  # closed - assets/tardis/models/item/doors/xxx_closed.json
  # animation frames - assets/tardis/models/item/doors/xxx_[sequential frame number].json
  animation_sequence: 0,1,2,3,4
  # the animation frame rate in ticks
  frame_rate: 6
  # whether the door has a third state activated by crouch-right-clicking
  # e.g. the double police door has one side open, closed, and a third "both sides open" state
  # the JSON file name for this state should be 1 greater than
  # the highest value of the animation_sequence, for this example it would be 5 e.g.:
  # extra state - assets/tardis/models/item/doors/centred_5.json
  has_extra: true
  # sfx - if using new custom sounds, you will need to add entries to assets/minecraft/sounds.json
  # and save .ogg files to assets/tardis/sounds/ in the resource pack
  # the sound for when the door opens
  open_sound: tardis_door_open
  # the sound for when the door closes
  close_sound: tardis_door_close
