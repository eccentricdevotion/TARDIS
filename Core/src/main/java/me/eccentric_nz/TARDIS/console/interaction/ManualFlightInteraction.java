/**
 * <p>The Astrosextant Rectifier will attempt to confirm that a TARDIS has arrived at the correct space-time
 * coordinates.</p><p>The Gravitic Anomaliser is a component of the TARDIS. It generates a localised field of artificial
 * gravity around the outside of the vessel.</p><p>The Absolute Tesseractulator is responsible for keeping track of a
 * TARDIS's dimensional location. It uses the Interstitial Antenna to collect data from the Vortex. A TARDIS knows where
 * it's going by using digitally-modelled time-cone isometry parallel-bussed into the image translator, with local
 * motion being mapped over every refresh-cycle. This information is displayed on the Gyro-Series Dials. It will detect
 * time travel induced by exterior forces (even if the TARDIS's drive is not activated). It is possible that a TARDIS
 * occasionally materializes in space to "get its bearings."</p>
