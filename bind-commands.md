# The Bind command
To make travelling to saved destinations, TARDIS areas, biomes, players and internal transmat locations easier you can &lsquo;bind&rsquo; them to buttons, levers and signs.

You can also bind the following commands:
```
/tardis hide
/tardis rebuild
/tardistravel home
```

### Binding

To bind the destination/command to a block run the command:
```
/tardisbind save [save name]
/tardisbind cmd [hide|rebuild|home|cave]
/tardisbind player [player name]
/tardisbind area [area name]
/tardisbind biome [biome name]
/tardisbind transmat [transmat name]
```


Follow the onscreen instructions, and click the block you want to bind.

### Unbinding

To unbind a destination/command from a block run the command:
```
/tardisbind remove [save|command|player|area]
```
You will receive a confirmation message that the block is now safe to be removed.
