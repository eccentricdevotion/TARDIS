# Perception Filter

You can craft a Perception Filter to make yourself partially invisible.

Type the command `/tardisrecipe filter` in game to view the crafting recipe.

Once crafted you can equip the Perception Filter in your chest armour slot by right-clicking air with the filter in hand.

To disable the filter just remove it from the chest armour slot.

**Note:** When travelling between worlds, the Perception Filter may go completely invisible — if this happens, just press your “sneak” key (usually LEFT-SHIFT) to make the player skin update.

**Note 2:** The Artron Energy readout will not display if you are wearing the Perception Filter.
