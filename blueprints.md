# Blueprints

TARDIS blueprints are a way for players to earn or purchase TARDIS features.
If enabled, blueprints suppliment server permissions &mdash; if a player attempts
to use a TARDIS feature, the following occurs:

1. A reglular server permission check is performed:
    * if the player has the correct permission they can use it as normal
    * if the player doesn't have the correct permission, proceed to step 2
2. A blue print check is performed:
    * if the player has condensed the blueprint they can use the feature
    * otherwise the player is denied use of the feature

### Enabling blueprints

To enable blueprints on your server, use the command:

    /tardisconfig blueprints true

To disable, run the command again with the last argument set to `false`.

### Obtaining blueprints

Blueprints are a form of TARDIS disk.

_Blueprints are keyed to a specific player &mdash; only the player who obtained
the blueprint can use it to upgrade their TARDIS with the blueprinted feature
the disk contains._

Players can obtain blueprints in a few ways:

1. By purchasing them from a TARDIS Shop. See the instructions on the
   [TARDIS Shop](tardis-shop.html) page for how to set this up.
2. Using the `/tardisadmin give [player] [blueprint]` command.
3. Using a system that can run the command above when certain conditions are met
   &mdash; for example a &ldquo;rank up&rdquo; plugin (or a command block &mdash; use the @p selector).

### Using blueprints

Once a player has obtained a blueprint they need to condense it in the TARDIS
Artron condenser. Once condensed the blueprint will be stored in the TARDIS&rsquo;
memory core.

### Removing a blueprint

To remove a player&rsquo;s ability to use a blueprint feature use the following command:

    /tardisadmin revoke [player] [permission]

To see a list of blueprint permissions use the command:

    /tardisadmin list blueprints
