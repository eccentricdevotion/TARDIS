# View Interior

As of TARDIS v4.11.0 you can view the interior of the TARDIS through the open Chameleon preset door). This feature is
currently a work in progress.

The Chameleon preset must be one with an _actual door block_, not a trapdoor or one of the coloured item frame Police
Boxes.

To enable/disable the viewing of interiors:

- use the command `/tardisconfig view_interior [true|false]`

There is one other config option - `policebox.view_interior_uses_console_size: [true|false]`, if `true` this sets the
view distance to the size of the TARDIS interior rather than the default 16 blocks.

When you open your exterior TARDIS door, you will see the interior features of your TARDIS.
