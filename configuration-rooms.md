# Room configuration

These config options are found in the file: `rooms.yml`

The rooms configuration sets the seed block and Artron Energy costs for growing rooms. Each room type has its own sub-section with two keys: the room `cost`, and the room `seed`.

The format is:

    rooms:
       [ROOMTYPE]:
          enabled: [true|false]
          cost: [amount]
          offset: [negative amount]
          seed: [MATERIAL]

All rooms are enabled by default, the rest of the settings are:
