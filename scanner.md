Follow the onscreen instructions.

## Use

To use the scanner, simply click the button/lever (or the _Scan_ button in the COntrol Menu).

The scanner will show information for the current location of the TARDIS Police Box, or, if a destination has been set,
the next travel location.

# Exterior Rendering Room

If you have grown a `Renderer` room, you are also shown a view of the immediate area around your TARDIS upon activating
the scanner.

You will be teleported into the room after the textual readout from the scanner has completed. The room consists of a
glass representation of your TARDIS, as well as a view of the immediate area around your travel device. Any water is
rendered as light blue stained glass, and lava as orange wool.
