Follow the onscreen instructions.

# Exterior Rendering Room

If you have grown a `Renderer` room, you are also shown a view of the immediate area around your TARDIS upon activating the scanner.

You will be teleported into the room after the textual readout from the scanner has completed. The room consists of a glass representation of your TARDIS, as well as a view of the immediate area around your travel device. Any water is rendered as light blue stained glass, and lava as orange wool.
