## Bug reports

A good bug report is actionable - it makes it clear what I need to do. So "it doesn't work" isn't really helpful, but "version 1.2 prints out errors (see attachment) when the TARDIS materialises" is. So please try to be as specific as possible.

## Feature requests

You can always request a feature. Whether I will implement it, depends on how much I like the feature, how much time I have and how complex the feature is. Of course, you can always try to implement the feature yourself. :smile:

## Pull requests

Pull requests (code contributions) are greatly appreciated. I try to accept all pull requests. However, there is always a chance that I need to reject a pull request, for example if a feature doesn't fit within the scope of TARDIS.

## Any questions?

If you have a question, feel free to open an issue.
