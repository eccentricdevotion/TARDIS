# Back doors

You can add a pair of doors to the TARDIS that allow you you to travel in and out of the TARDIS from a fixed location.

Place the (IRON) doors where you want them — one inside and one outside the TARDIS, and the run the following command on each of them:

    /tardis update backdoor

Follow the onscreen instructions.

Make sure you are entering/exiting the TARDIS normally (don’t TP) when using the update command.

## Use

Right-click the door with your TARDIS key.

Back doors use Artron Energy each time you go through them.

Players require the permission `tardis.backdoor`

### Note

The back door is (IMO) for cheaters… it allows you to place 2 static doors — one inside and one outside, that give you access to the TARDIS interior no matter where the exterior is located, so you could for example have a door in your house that lets you enter the TARDIS, or the reverse — a door in the TARDIS that is permanently linked to one location.
