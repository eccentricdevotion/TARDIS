/**
 * Snowmen are sculptures fashioned in the shape of men. They are built of snow, and items are usually added as
 * accessories. In 1892 London, the Great Intelligence brought snowmen to life to take over the world. The snowmen could
 * be summoned if someone was thinking about them, thanks to being made of telepathic snow, but if said person thought
 * about melting the snowmen, they would melt.
