/**
 * The smiling axolotl is hard to beat. This little salamander, which is perpetually in a larval state
 * (hence the adorable gills), can come back from almost any beating it takes. Axolotls can recover muscle function
 * after being paralyzed. They can regrow their limbs, eyes, tails, and parts of the heart. You can induce a stroke in
 * an axolotl and part of its brain will grow back.
