# BlockName:      must be the name of a block. May include block data, like "WOOL:1".
# BlockSource:    list of blocks the resource can spawn on/in. You can also use "Solid" or "All".
# Frequency:      number of attempts to place this resource in each chunk.
# Rarity:         chance for each attempt, Rarity:100 - mean 100% to pass, Rarity:1 - mean 1% to pass.
# MinAltitude and MaxAltitude: height limits.
# BlockSource:    mean where or whereupon resource will be placed

# TreeTypeChance: similar to Rarity. Example:
#                 Tree(10,Taiga1,35,Taiga2,100) - plugin tries 10 times, for each attempt it tries to place Taiga1 (35% chance),

#                 or simply a BlockName
# IceSpikeType:   one of the ice spike types: Basement,SmallSpike,HugeSpike
# Object:         can be a any kind of custom object (bo2 or bo3) but without the file extension. You can
#                 also use UseWorld to spawn one of the object in the WorldObjects folder and UseBiome to spawn
#                 one of the objects in the BiomeObjects setting. When using BO2s for UseWorld, the BO2 must have
#                 this biome in their spawnInBiome setting.

# Plant and Grass resource: both a resource of one block. Plant can place blocks underground, Grass cannot.
# Liquid resource: a one-block water or lava source
# SmallLake and UnderGroundLake resources: small lakes of about 8x8 blocks
# Vein resource: not in vanilla. Starts an area where ores will spawn. Can be slow, so use a low Rarity (smaller than 1).
# CustomStructure resource: starts a BO3 structure in the chunk.
