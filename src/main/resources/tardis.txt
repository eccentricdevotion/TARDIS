Welcome, Timelord @p
It seems that you are without transport. This world contains the resources that will let you to recreate your lost TARDIS.

Here is a list of items you will need to collect or mine:
1 Log
1 Redstone Ore
9 Iron Ore
2-3 Lapis Lazuli Ore
8 Cobblestone
1-2 Coal Ore
4 other blocks of almost any type
1 Gold Nugget

Once you have your items, craft a furnace to smelt the iron. Craft an Iron Block, a Lapis Block and a Redstone Torch.

Now you need to craft a TARDIS seed block.
Here is the 3x3 crafting grid:
369
258
147

You need to place items in the grid in the following order:
1: Iron Block
2: Lapis Block
3: Redstone Torch

4: Empty
5: Empty
6: Empty

7: A block to set the floors of the TARDIS interior
8: A block to set the walls of the TARDIS interior
9: Empty

Let the crafting output the seed.
Now place the seed block, and click it with your TARDIS key - this is a Gold Nugget by default.

Stand back and watch your new TARDIS materialise before your eyes! You can enter with your TARDIS key.

You still need power to travel the Time Vortex. Look for the Artron Energy Capacitor button (it's made of wood) and click it with your TARDIS key.

You can achieve many great things in your TARDIS, and be rewarded for your efforts. Use the command '/tardisbook list' to view other tasks.
