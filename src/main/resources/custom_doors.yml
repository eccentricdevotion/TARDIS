  # number is added to the starting (closed) animation frame to
  # get the "custom_model_data" predicate e.g. 10000 + 3 = 10003

  # e.g. the double police door has one side open, closed, and a third "both sides open" state
  # the "custom_model_data" predicate for this state should be 1 greater than
  # the highest value of the animation_sequence, for this example it would be 5
