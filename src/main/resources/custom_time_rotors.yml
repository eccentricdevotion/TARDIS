# visit https://tardis.pages.dev/custom-rotors for more info
# this entry is FuzzyLeo's classic time rotor
classic:
  # custom model data for the rotor's inventory item and off state model
  # must be added as a "custom_model_data" predicate in
  # assets/minecraft/models/item/light_gray_dye.json
  # must be higher than 10000009
  off_custom_model_data: 10000010
  # the material of the animated rotor item
  # animation states will need to be set with "custom_model_data" predicates
  # in assets/minecraft/models/item/[animated_material].json starting at 1021
  # material must be unique for each rotor, the plugin already uses:
  # BLACK_DYE, ORANGE_DYE, BROWN_DYE, GRAY_DYE, CYAN_DYE, LIGHT_BLUE_DYE, BLUE_DYE, WHITE_DYE
  animated_material: YELLOW_DYE
  # a comma separated list of frame numbers where the
  # number is added to the starting animation frame to
  # get the "custom_model_data" predicate e.g. 1021 + 3 = 1024
  animation_sequence: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7
  # the animation frame rate in ticks
