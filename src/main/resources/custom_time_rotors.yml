# this entry is FuzzyLeo's classic time rotor
classic:
  # A model definition for the rotor's inventory item must be added as a
  # "minecraft:custom_name" predicate in `assets/minecraft/items/light_gray_dye.json`
  #
  # the material of the animated rotor item
  # material must be unique for each rotor, the plugin already uses:
  # BLACK_DYE, ORANGE_DYE, BROWN_DYE, GRAY_DYE, CYAN_DYE, LIGHT_BLUE_DYE, BLUE_DYE, WHITE_DYE
  animated_material: YELLOW_DYE
  # a comma separated list of frame numbers to determine the
  # model definition file names e.g. time_rotor_classic_0.json
  # animation states will need to be set with model definitions
  # in the assets/tardis/items/ resource pack folder
  animation_sequence: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7
  # the animation frame rate in ticks
  frame_rate: 6
