# a list of the custom models you want to use
models:
  # model name
  Type 40:
    # the item that is placed on the armour stand
    item: CLAY_BALL
  Bad Wolf:
    item: WOLF_SPAWN_EGG

# Custom JSON model files are required for each TARDIS visual
# open/closed door + 2 stages of materialisation (coloured/clear)
# + a (bigger) model used when the player is viewing the exterior
#
# These files should be named (all lowercase, replace spaces with underscores)
# and placed into the assets/tardis/models/item/police_box/ directory.
# You must use the appropriate suffixes as shown below.

# e.g.:
#
#      assets/tardis/models/item/police_box/type_40_camera.json
#      assets/tardis/models/item/police_box/type_40_closed.json
#      assets/tardis/models/item/police_box/type_40_glass.json
#      assets/tardis/models/item/police_box/type_40_open.json
#      assets/tardis/models/item/police_box/type_40_stained.json
#
# and:
#
#      assets/tardis/models/item/police_box/bad_wolf_camera.json
#      assets/tardis/models/item/police_box/bad_wolf_closed.json
#      assets/tardis/models/item/police_box/bad_wolf_glass.json
#      assets/tardis/models/item/police_box/bad_wolf_open.json
#      assets/tardis/models/item/police_box/bad_wolf_stained.json
#
# You will also need to add item model definitions to assets/tardis/items directory
# that point to the custom model files - use the same names.
#
# e.g. the contents of assets/tardis/items/type_40_closed.json would be:
#
# {
#    "model": {
#       "type": "minecraft:model",
#       "model": "tardis:item/police_box/type_40_closed"
#    }
# }
