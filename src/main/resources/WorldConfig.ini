# What Terrain Control does with the config files.
# Possible modes:
#    WriteAll - default
#    WriteWithoutComments - write config files without help comments
#    WriteDisable - doesn't write to the config files, it only reads. Doesn't auto-update the configs. Use with care!
SettingsMode: WriteAll

# Possible terrain modes:
#    Normal - use all features
#    TerrainTest - generate only terrain without any resources
#    NotGenerate - generate empty chunks
#    Default - use default terrain generator
#    OldGenerator - Minecraft Beta 1.7.3-like land generator
TerrainMode: Normal

# Possible biome modes:
#    Normal - use all features
#    FromImage - get biomes from image file
#    Default - use default Notch biome generator
# For old maps two more modes are available:
#    BeforeGroups - Minecraft 1.0 - 1.6.4 biome generator, only supports the biome groups NormalBiomes and IceBiomes
#    OldGenerator - Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 biome generator

# You need to register your custom biomes here. This setting will make Terrain Control
# generate setting files for them. However, it won't place them in the world automatically.
# See the settings for your BiomeMode below on how to add them to the world.

# Syntax: CustomBiomes:BiomeName:id[,AnotherBiomeName:id[,...]]
# Example: CustomBiomes:TestBiome1:30,BiomeTest2:31
# This will add two biomes and generate the BiomeConfigs for them.
# All changes here need a server restart.

# Due to the way Mojang's loading code works, all biome ids need to be unique
# on the server. If you don't do this, the client will display the biomes just fine,
# but the server can think it is another biome with the same id. This will cause saplings,
# snowfall and mobs to work as in the other biome.

# The available ids range from 0 to 1023 and the ids 0-39 and 129-167 are taken by vanilla.
# The ids 256-1023 cannot be saved to the map files, so use ReplaceToBiomeName in that biome.

# Minecraft groups similar biomes together, so that they spawn next to each other.

# Syntax: BiomeGroup(Name, Size, Rarity, BiomeName[, AnotherName[, ...]])
# Name - just for clarity, choose something descriptive
# Size - layer to generate on, from 0 to GenerationDepth. All biomes in the group must have a BiomeSize
#        larger than or equal to this value.
# Rarity - relative spawn chances.
# BiomeName... - names of the biome that spawn in the group. Case sensitive.

# Note: if you're using BiomeMode: BeforeGroups, only the biome names of the groups named NormalBiomes
# and IceBiomes and the size and rarity of the group named IceBiomes will be used. Other groups are
# ignored. The size and rarity of the NormalBiomes group is ignored as well, use LandSize and
# LandRarity instead.
