# TODO
0. Add a handbreak (lever) that trigers the dematerialising/materialising before they travel
   to the place instead of being activated by the door. As the door should only be the door
   not what triggers the events. ex: they press the hand break after they select there destantion 
   and it starts the process. Then no one can use the door untill the handbreak is activated and teh tardis materlise.
   This would make the tardis be allowed for more ideas that I have for other effects.
1. If WorldGuard is installed, automatically protect the 3x3 region around a recharging beacon.
2. Decrease materialsation time?
3. Check what happens when companions use the TARDIS with regards to:
   - Recharging
4. Update schematic dimensions so all rooms have their own dimensions
   - Still undecided whether we should allow/can actually let players use their own room schematics
5. Do a whole bunch of tutorial videos
6. TEST, TEST, TEST

#Minecraft API when available
1. Create custom blocks for the tardis box and console.
2. If using the lapis block have the walls a special tardis wall block.
3. A tardis key that is a Sonic Screwdriver, also a crafting for that item.
4. GUI if allowed
5. Sounds if allowed
