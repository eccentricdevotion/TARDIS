# Sonic Blaster

This TARDIS module is a work in progress, and as such the documentation is far from complete!

A sonic blaster, or squareness gun, is a type of weapon available in the 51st century. They were produced at the
Villengard factory, until it was destroyed by the Doctor, and replaced by banana groves.

> Bananas are good

## Use

> The blaster uses digital technology to create a sonic wave, projected into the form of pulsing squares of blue light,
> which could can through thick walls. It also has a reverse function which can replace the removed chunk of material
> afterwards. This is deemed a "special feature" of the blaster, and is said to use up a lot of the batteries on which
> it runs.
