# Condenser chest

One of the ways to recharge the Artron Energy Capacitor is to convert raw materials into energy. You can do this with the TARDISâ€™s condenser chest.

The condenser chest is automatically added to newly created TARDISes, but there are two other ways to add the chest:

1. Place a chest, and use the `/tardis update condenser` command
2. Grow an **Eye of Harmony** room. The Eye of Harmony contains a chest which is automatically set as the condenser.

### Using the condenser

To convert materials to Artron Energy, place them in the Condenser chest and then close it. Any valid materials will be converted, and you will receive a message stating how much energy was generated.

A list of condensable items and their relative values can be found on the [Condensables](condensables.html) page.

### Server condenser

As of TARDIS v3.0-beta-1, you can now add a public server condenser. This allows players to top up their Artron Energy without having to be inside the TARDIS. This is useful if a player has used the last of their energy to hide the TARDIS.

To add a server condenser, place a chest, target it, then run the command:

    /tardisadmin condenser

The server condenser works the same way as the interior TARDIS condenser.
