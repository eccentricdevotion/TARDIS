# TARDIS

TARDIS is a Spigot/Paper plugin that allows you to create a TARDIS that lets you time travel (teleport) to random locations. It adds a Whovian twist to the typical /sethome and /home commands.

**As a player, you can:**

* Create a TARDIS that is bigger on the inside.
* Time travel to a random location.
* Time travel to saved destinations.
* Grow rooms in your TARDIS.
* Take companions with you when you time travel.
* Collect Artron Energy to power your TARDIS.
* And so much more...
