# Travelling

You can time travel in the TARDIS by using the controls on the TARDIS console.

### Repeaters

There are multiple repeaters in your TARDIS, and each has its own function.

The repeater closest to the door controls the environment type of the world you will travel to.

- The 1-tick position will select the world where the TARDIS is currently located
- The 2-tick position will select from (Normal) Overworlds (except the current world)
- The 3-tick position will select from Nether worlds
- The 4-tick position will select The End worlds

**Note:** Going to other types of world may require more Artron Energy.

With your back to the door, the left and right repeaters control the Z and X coordinates respectively. The longer the delay/larger the gap on the repeaters = a greater distance.

The farthest repeater from the door is a multiplier for distance traveled. The same rule as the longer delay from above applies here as well.

To travel to a random destination, set the repeaters to your desired settings.

### Stone button and handbrake

Your TARDIS comes equipped with a stone button & a handbrake (lever).

The stone button “sets” your destination to a random location with respect to the repeater settings from the section above, and the handbrake initiates travel and parks your TARDIS.

1. Click the stone button and your TARDIS will lock on to a destination.
2. Disengage the handbrake by **RIGHT** -clicking it.
3. Once the TARDIS has finished navigating the time vortex (see [flight modes](flight-modes.html)), **LEFT** -click the handbrake to park (best not to be in creative mode!).
