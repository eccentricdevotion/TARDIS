# Planets

The TARDIS plugin has 3 built-in planets from the Whoniverse. To enable the planets on the server use the
command `/tardisworld enable [gallifrey|siluria|skaro]` - this will enable the worlds on _planets.yml_, load the related
listener classes on the server, and generate the spawn chunks ready for TARDIS time travel.

### Prior to v4.9.0

The planets are created by installing custom datapacks on the server. To enable the planets on the server use the
command `/tardisworld load [gallifrey|siluria|skaro]` - this will install the appropriate custom dimension datapack on
the server, and the world will be generated on the next server restart. The worlds will be named according to vanilla
Minecraft conventions using the default world name as specified in `server.properties` e.g. _world_tardis_gallifrey_,
_world_tardis_siluria_, and _world_tardis_skaro_

The planets are listed and described below!

## Note

To get the best experience on these planets, it's recommended to download the accompanying plugin and resource pack.
Otherwise, mobs will look like vanilla mobs!

## Planet Skaro

![planet skaro](images/docs/skaro.jpg)

- This world is limited to the customised Desert biome.
- If configured, all water is acid and will harm / kill the player (wearing armour reduces the effect). Use a boat!
- Dalek structures will generate automatically as you explore the world — there are currently two Dalek building types,
  a big
  main building and a smaller corridor type one, and some other village type structures will also spawn nearby.
- Daleks will spawn in the big main buildings. There is a 10% chance that a Dalek will spawn flying in the air, but this
  can be disabled in the config described below.
- A random loot chest is located in the main Dalek building — wear plenty of armour if you want to raid these!
- You can fill Acid Buckets and Rust Buckets by using an empty bucket on water and lava. Acid Buckets can be used to
  make Acid Batteries, which in turn can be used to make [Rift Manipulators](rift-manipulator.html). Rust Buckets are
  used in the crafting recipe for the [Rust Plague](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Rust_plague) Sword - this deals more
  damage to Daleks (Update the TARDIS-MCP resource pack to see the textures).

## Planet Gallifrey

![planet gallifrey](images/docs/gallifrey.jpg)

- This world is limited to customised Badlands, Wooded Badlands and Eroded Badlands biomes.
- Time Lord structures will generate automatically as you explore the world — multiple buildings will be grouped in a
  small village.
- Time Lords will spawn in these structures.
- A random loot chest is also located in the structures.

## Planet Siluria

![planet siluria](images/docs/siluria.jpg)

- This world is limited to the Bamboo Jungle and Bamboo Jungle Hills biomes.
- Structures will generate automatically as you explore the jungles.
- Silurians will spawn in these structures.
- A random loot chest is also located in the structures.

## Enabling Planets

All planets must be enabled using the `/tardisworld enable` command. There are some world specific options in
the [planets.yml configuration file](configuration-planets). Below is a sample code, and it is commented to describe
each line.

For acid potion effects, see
the [Bukkit PotionType Enum](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/potion/PotionType.html).

```yaml
# other config #
# Planet name
world_tardis_skaro:
  # Whether this world should be created and managed by TARDIS.
  # This must be enabled to load the world and requires a restart.
  enabled: false
  # Whether the world should generate vanilla structures
  generate_structures: true

  #### The following are exclusive to Skaro. ###
  # Whether all the water in the world is acid (and harms the player).
  acid: true
  # the amount of damage a player takes when in acid water each second.
  acid_damage: 5
  # Optional list of potion effects to give the player when they are in acid water.
  acid_potions:
    - WEAKNESS
    - POISON
  # Whether rust is enabled (not actually used yet).
  rust: true
  # Whether or not to enable flying daleks
  flying_daleks: true

  ## other terrain options, see planets configuration ##

  # Exclusive to custom planets.
  # Should non-doctor who (vanilla) mobs spawn?
  spawn_other_mobs: true
# other config #
```

**tl;dr:**

1. Use the command `/tardisworld enable [gallifrey|siluria|skaro]`
2. (Re)start the server
