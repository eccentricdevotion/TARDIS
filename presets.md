# Chameleon Presets

Chameleon Presets can be selected and applied in the [Chameleon Circuit](chameleon-circuit.html) GUI. There are 64 presets in total on two pages, plus one special hidden preset, and one custom preset that server admins can set up themselves — see the [Custom preset page.](custom-preset.html)

## Page one

These presets use regular Minecraft blocks. When materialising they cycle through stained glass and regular glass for their animation.
