# Rail room

TARDIS provides an easy way to get materials into its interior. The method uses a storage minecart to deposit items into a hopper, which you can then do with as you please.

## Getting it working

Setting up the system is a multi-step process:

1. Grow a rail room
2. Move your TARDIS to a location and **save it**
3. Move the TARDIS to a different location
4. Run rails up to the TARDIS (exterior) door — **Note:** it must be a preset with a door, change the exterior preset if necessary
5. Travel back to your saved location from step 1

The design of the rail system is up to you, but only one minecart can be inside the rail room at a time, so you will need to take that into consideration.

The rail room can also be customised to suit your needs. The TARDIS plugin needs to know where the fence / rail is that the minecart will spawn on. You can update the position of the fence using the `/tardis update rail` command and then clicking on the fence.

**Note:** if Multiverse-Inventories is enabled on the server, you should make sure that the minecart world and the TARDIS world are sharing inventories. To add TARDIS worlds to a default share group, edit the `creation.inventory_group` setting in the TARDIS config — see the [TARDIS creation configuration options](configuration-creation.html) page.
