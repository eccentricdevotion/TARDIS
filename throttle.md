# Space Time Throttle

The Space Time Thottle is a TARDIS control that sets the speed of flight through the Time Vortex i.e. how long flights
take.

In game, the Space Time Thottle is a locked redstone repeater &mdash; each tick setting determines a different speed,
and a corresponding increase in the amount of Artron energy consumed:

| Setting | Speed  | Artron energy requirements |
|---------|--------|----------------------------|
| 1 tick  | Normal | Normal                     |
| 2 ticks | Faster | 1.5 x normal               |
| 3 ticks | Rapid  | 2 x normal                 |
| 4 ticks | Warp   | 3 x  normal                |

### Adding the Space Time Thottle

Place a redstone repeater, then use the command:

```
/tardis update throttle
```

## Important note!

The Space Time Thottle has no effect under the following circumstances:

* The TARDIS flight mode is set to `MANUAL` or `REGULATOR`
* The TARDIS isn&rsquo;t actually travelling e.g. rebuilding, hiding, Siege mode
* Hostile Action Displacement (HADS) &mdash; the TARDIS will travel at normal speed
* Time travel malfunctions &mdash; the TARDIS will travel at normal speed
* Junk TARDIS / Junk Mode &mdash; the travel speed is the regular Junk speed
