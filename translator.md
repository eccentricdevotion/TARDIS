# TARDIS Universal Translator

The translation circuit is a part of the TARDIS that allows instantaneous translation of most languages spoken or written in the universe.

You can send translated text in chat using the `/tardissay [language] [message]`, for example:

    /tardissay SWEDISH hello world

## How it works

The command uses the free Bing translation API to translate your message — see the list of supported languages below.

- `[language]` — You need to specify the language you want to translate into
- `[message]` — The plugin tries to auto-detect the language that you are typing in, however you can force the language it uses by setting a player preference:

    /tardisprefs language [language]
