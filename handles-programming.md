# Handles Programming

Clicking on Handles while sneaking opens the Handles Programming GUI where you can create program disks, allowing you to
extend Handlesâ€™ functionality with events, actions, and Advanced Console Disks.

The Handles programming is block based &mdash; instructions are represented as blocks that you add in a particular order
to create a program that Handles can run.
