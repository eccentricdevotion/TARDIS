# Crafting Biome and Preset Disks

Biome and Preset Storage Disks have data crafted into them by combining a Blank Biome or Preset disk with the appropriate item.

### Crafting the blank disks

You will need a blank storage disk first — `/tardisrecipe blank`

- By default a Biome Storage Disk is crafted with a Blank Storage Disk and an Emerald.
- By default a Preset Storage Disk is crafted with a Blank Storage Disk and a Chameleon Circuit.

Check the recipes using the `/tardisrecipe [biome-disk|preset-disk]` command.

## Biome Storage Disks

There are two levels of Biome Storage Disk — regular biomes and ‘higher’ biomes, for example: a regular biome would be DESERT, and a ‘higher’ biome would be DESERT\_HILLS. ‘higher’ biomes are crafted the same way as for regular biomes, but with the addition to the recipe of a LADDER.

To craft the disk combine a Blank Biome Storage Disk with the correct item. Currently the only Biome Storage Disks you can craft are shown in the table below:
