# Alternative controls

### The ‘save’ sign

As of version v2.2-beta-1, the ‘save’ sign is automatically added to the main TARDIS control room. If you are missing a save sign, add it with the command `/tardis update save-sign`

The ‘save’ sign can be used to quickly set the TARDIS’s destination

- Right-clicking the sign will cycle through the TARDIS’s saved destinations, as well as the TARDIS ‘Home’ location.
- Right-clicking the sign while sneaking will set the TARDIS destination to the save currently shown on the sign.

### The TARDIS ‘keyboard’

As of version v2.4-beta-1, you can add a TARDIS keyboard to set destinations.

To use it:

1. Place a sign in the TARDIS control room
2. Use the command `/tardis update keyboard`, then click the sign
3. Right-click the ‘keyboard’ with another sign, OR (if [ProtocolLib](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/protocollib/) is installed), just right-click the sign
4. Enter a save/area/player/biome on the first line or coordinates (world,x,y,z) on four lines
5. Click done and the destination will be set
