# Flying the TARDIS

From version 5 of the TARDIS plugin, you can fly the TARDIS exterior around your worlds.
_The feature only works with the custom model police box presets_, so you will also need to use the 
[TARDIS Resource Pack](http://tardisjenkins.duckdns.org:8080/job/TARDIS-Resource-Pack/).

### Permission

You will need the permission `tardis.fly` to pilot your TARDIS.

## How to fly

- __Right-click__ the handbrake while __sneaking__ to pilot the TARDIS in the world
- Use the movement keys (__WASD__) to navigate
- Look up to go up
- Look down to go down
- Press the __Shift__ key to stop flying (best to do this when on the ground!)

When you click the handbrake, you will be teleported to the TARDIS exterior - you will most 
likely want to switch your view to third-person mode by pressing the __F5__ key on the keyboard.
Pressing the Shift key will teleport you back into the TARDIS interior - left-click the handbrake
to park the TARDIS and exit.
